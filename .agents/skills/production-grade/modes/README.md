# Mode Reference Index

> **Purpose:** Maps each of Forgewright's 23 modes to their location in `SKILL.md`.
> This file provides a quick reference; full mode descriptions are in `skills/production-grade/SKILL.md`.

## Shared Behaviors (All Modes)

All modes share these behaviors (see `SKILL.md` → Mode Execution):

- Bootstrap workspace: `mkdir -p skills/_shared/protocols/ .forgewright/`
- Write shared protocols from `skills/_shared/protocols/`
- Read `.production-grade.yaml` for path overrides
- Read existing workspace state if present
- Apply coding-level adaptation
- **Run plan quality loop** on every skill — plan first, score ≥ 9.0
- **Asynchronous heartbeat** — periodic status updates to user
- Engagement mode: ask only if mode involves 3+ skills

## Single-Skill Modes (Skip Plan Presentation)

These modes skip plan presentation — classify and invoke immediately:

`Test`, `Review`, `Document`, `Explore`, `Analyze`, `Prompt`

## Multi-Skill Modes (Present Plan)

These modes present a plan for user confirmation:

`Feature`, `Harden`, `Ship`, `Optimize`, `Architect`, `Design`, `Debug`, `AI Build`, `Migrate`, `Custom`
