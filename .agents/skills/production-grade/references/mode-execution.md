# Mode Execution Reference

<!-- source: skills/production-grade/references/mode-execution.md -->

## Mode Execution (Non-Full-Build)

All modes share these behaviors:
- Bootstrap workspace: `mkdir -p skills/_shared/protocols/ .forgewright/`
- Write shared protocols (same as Full Build step 3)
- Read `.production-grade.yaml` for path overrides
- Read existing workspace state if present
- Apply coding-level adaptation from `.production-grade.yaml` (see main orchestrator config)
- Apply sensitive file protection protocol for all file operations
- **Run plan quality loop** on EVERY skill invocation — plan first, score ≥ 9.0 before any work begins
- **Asynchronous Heartbeat:** Periodically emit human-readable status updates (e.g., "Running tests...", "Applying self-healing fix 2/5...") so the user knows the AI is working and hasn't frozen.
- **⚠️ QA AUTO-RUN (MANDATORY):** Apply complexity-based hybrid testing flow. For complex tasks, the sequence is: Given/When/Then (BA) → Write Tests/Stubs (QA) → Code (Dev) → Run Tests → Pass ✓. For simple tasks: Code (Dev) → Write & Run Tests (QA) → Pass ✓. Never finish without verifying tests pass.
- **Antigravity Planning (for large features):** Features with 3+ components MUST use antigravity planning structure BEFORE starting implementation. Create `antigravity/planning/[feature-name]/` with PLAN.md, SCOPE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, TASKS.md files.
- Engagement mode: ask ONLY if mode involves 3+ skills. For 1-2 skill modes, use Standard engagement + Sequential execution.

### Goal Mode Execution (v8.2)

When Goal mode is triggered, Forgewright enters autonomous pursuit mode:

```
1. SET GOAL:
   - Parse condition from user message
   - Validate condition is measurable
   - Create .forgewright/active-goal.json

2. AUTONOMOUS LOOP:
   After each turn:
   a. Run evaluation:
      bash scripts/goal-evaluate.py "[condition]"
   b. Check result:
      - MET: Report completion, clear goal, exit autonomous mode
      - NOT_MET: Continue to next turn (no user prompt needed)
      - UNKNOWN: Ask user to verify

3. PROGRESS TRACKING:
   - Write progress to .forgewright/goal-progress.md
   - Update turns counter in active-goal.json
   - Emit heartbeat: "Working toward goal: [reason why not met yet]"

4. EXIT CONDITIONS:
   - Condition is met (evaluator returns MET)
   - User runs `/goal clear`
   - Safety limit reached (max_turns, timeout)
   - User explicitly stops
```

**Integration with other skills:** Goal mode wraps ANY skill execution. The underlying skill does the work; Goal mode handles the loop and evaluation.

## ⚠️ Self-Check Before Finishing (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE declaring a task complete, verify ALL of the following:**

| # | Check | Action if Failed |
|---|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Request interpreted?** | If Step 0 wasn't completed, go back and do it |
| 2 | **Plan scored ≥ 9.0?** | If < 9.0, improve plan before proceeding |
| 3 | **ASIP Research Gate followed?** | If 2 failures occurred → research + skill update was mandatory |
| 4 | **Lessons written?** | Append to skill SKILL.md + .forgewright/lessons.md |
| 5 | **Test cases prepared?** | For medium/large features, write test stubs first |
| 6 | **Code changed?** | Implement code to satisfy requirements & test cases |
| 7 | **Tests run & verified?** | Run QA tests to verify 100% pass |
| 8 | **gitnexus_impact run?** | If editing symbols → run impact analysis |
| 9 | **Scope respected?** | If scope creep detected → flag to user |
| 10 | **User approval obtained?** | If gate exists → wait for approval |
| 11 | **Review mode respected?** | If Full mode → run director reviews; if Solo → confirm skip OK |
| 12 | **ASIP metrics updated?** | Increment counters in .forgewright/asip-metrics.json |

**⚠️ NEVER finish a task without completing checks 3-5 and 7 if code was changed.**

### QA Test Sequence (MANDATORY complexity-based hybrid flow)

```
For Complex Tasks:   Given/When/Then (BA) → Write Tests/Stubs (QA) → Code (Dev) → Run Tests → Pass ✓
For Simple Tasks:    Code (Dev) → Write & Run Tests (QA) → Pass ✓
```

**Do NOT wait for user to ask for tests. Run/verify them automatically.**

## Antigravity Planning System

|--------------|--------------|
| Single file change | ❌ No |
| Small (1-2 components) | ❌ No |
| Medium (3+ components) | ✅ Yes |

See `antigravity/README.md` for full documentation.

### Feature Mode

Add a feature to an existing codebase. Lightweight DEFINE → BUILD → TEST.

1. **Codebase scan** — read existing code structure, framework, patterns
2. **BA pre-flight (conditional)** — Assess the user's feature description for information gaps using 6W1H. If requirements score < 6/7 completeness → run BA (Express depth) to elicit missing info. If clear → skip. Log: `✓ Requirements complete — skipping BA` or `⧖ Information gaps detected — running BA elicitation`
3. **PM (Express depth)** — 2-3 questions to scope the feature. Write a mini-BRD (user stories + acceptance criteria for this feature only). If BA ran, use `ba-package.md` to reduce questions.
4. **Architect (scoped)** — design how this feature fits the existing architecture. New endpoints, schema changes, component additions. NOT a full system redesign.
5. **Test Cases/Stubs Preparation** — QA Engineer writes test stubs based on BDD/Gherkin spec from the BA package (Mandatory for medium/large features; optional for simple fixes).
6. **Build** — Software Engineer and/or Frontend Engineer implement the feature code to satisfy requirements and test cases.
7. **⚠️ Test Verification (AUTO-RUN)** — Run and verify tests. DO NOT WAIT for user to ask. Sequence: Given/When/Then (BA) → Write Tests/Stubs (QA) → Code (Dev) → Run Tests → Pass ✓.
8. **Optional: Review** — Code Reviewer checks the new code against existing patterns

**1 gate:** After PM scoping (step 3), confirm scope before test case preparation.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Step 7 (Test Verification) is MANDATORY. After building, ALWAYS run tests without waiting for user prompt.

### Harden Mode

Security + quality audit on existing code. No building, pure analysis + fixes.

1. **Codebase scan** — read all existing code
2. **Sequential:** Security Engineer → QA Engineer → Code Reviewer analyze the code
3. **Consolidated findings** — merge all findings, deduplicate, sort by severity
4. **Present findings** — show Critical/High/Medium/Low counts with top issues
5. **Remediation** — fix Critical and High issues (with user confirmation)

**1 gate:** After findings (step 4), before remediation.

### Ship Mode

1. Read `skills/notebooklm-researcher/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions
2. Check authentication: `nlm auth status`
3. Check for existing notebooks before creating new: `nlm notebook list`
4. **Phase 1 — Discovery:** Identify if this is a new topic (→ create notebook) or existing notebook (→ add sources)
5. **Phase 2 — Source Ingestion:** Add source URLs, text notes, or YouTube videos. Use `nlm research start --mode deep` for automatic web discovery
6. **Phase 3 — NotebookLM Synthesis:** Use `notebook describe`, `notebook query`, `cross query` to synthesize findings
7. **Phase 4 — Content Generation:** Generate study materials: audio (podcast), report (briefing doc/study guide), quiz, flashcards, slides, infographic
8. **Phase 5 — Cross-Notebook (if needed):** Query across multiple notebooks for comparative research
9. **Phase 6 — Handoff:** Format findings as research report with citations, hand off to relevant mode

2. **Start Feature mode — build what was analyzed**
3. **Start Full Build — full pipeline from this analysis**
4. **Done — I just needed the analysis**
