# Forgewright Self-Test Orchestrator

> **Purpose:** Validates Forgewright's own behavior including mode classification, plan quality scoring, and middleware chain execution.

**Source:** This skill is part of Phase 1 (Quick Wins) of the Forgewright improvement plan (v9). It ensures Forgewright tests itself systematically before shipping changes.

---

## Overview

The Test Orchestrator provides automated testing for core Forgewright behaviors:

| Category | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| Mode Classification | 24 modes (100%) |
| Plan Quality Scoring | 9 criteria |
| Middleware Chain | 14 stages |
| Memory Retrieval | 5 key operations |
| Skill Routing | 15 edge cases |

---

## Test Runner

```bash
# Run all tests
bash scripts/run-self-tests.sh

# Run specific category
bash scripts/run-self-tests.sh --category mode-classification

# Run with verbose output
bash scripts/run-self-tests.sh --verbose

# Generate coverage report
bash scripts/run-self-tests.sh --coverage
```

### Plan Quality Scoring Tests

Tests that verify the 9-criteria scoring rubric works correctly.

| Criterion | Weight | Min Score |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Completeness | 1.0 | 0.888 (8/9) |
| Specificity | 1.0 | 0.888 (8/9) |
| Feasibility | 1.0 | 0.888 (8/9) |
| Risk Awareness | 1.0 | 0.888 (8/9) |
| Scope Control | 1.0 | 1.0 (9/9) |
| Dependency Ordering | 1.0 | 1.111 (10/9) |
| Testability | 1.0 | 0.888 (8/9) |
| Impact Assessment | 1.0 | 0.777 (7/9) |
| Evidence Verification | 1.0 | 0.888 (8/9) |

### Middleware Chain Tests

Tests that verify the 14-stage middleware chain executes correctly.

| Stage | Description | Max Latency |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Session Data Load | 200ms |
| 2 | Context/Memory Load | 300ms |
| 3 | Dry Run Context | 100ms |
| 4 | Skill Registry Load | 200ms |
| 5 | Guardrail Check | 100ms |
| 6 | Summarization | 200ms |
| 7 | Quality Gate Check | 100ms |
| 8 | Brownfield Safety Check | 200ms |
| 9 | Task Tracking Update | 100ms |
| 10 | Memory fact extraction | 300ms |
| 11 | Graceful Failure handler | 100ms |
| 12 | ASIP Self-Healing Loop | 2000ms |
| 13 | Circuit Breaker | 100ms |
| 14 | Evidence Verification | 500ms |

## Test Case Format

Each test case follows this structure:

```yaml
test_id: T1.3.1
category: mode-classification
description: "Mode classification: 'build a SaaS' triggers Full Build"
input:
  user_request: "build a SaaS for pet adoption"
expected:
  mode: "Full Build"
  confidence: ">=0.9"
  routing: "orchestrator"
```

---

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Mode Coverage | 100% (24/24) | 0% |
| Plan Scoring Coverage | 100% (9/9) | 0% |
| Middleware Coverage | 100% (14/14) | 0% |
| Overall Test Pass Rate | >=95% | N/A |
| CI Integration | Yes | No |

---

## CI Integration

Add to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/self-test.yml
- name: Run Forgewright Self-Tests
  run: |
    bash scripts/run-self-tests.sh --coverage --junit results.xml
```

---

## Future Enhancements
